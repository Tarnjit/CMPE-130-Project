Instructions on how to run our program. 
--------------------------------------------------------

Our program is very easy to use as we have implemented a user friendly menu!
All you need to do is simply follow the menu prompts shown below: 

     GAS 4 LESS 
=====================================
What brand gasoline would you like?

 1. Chevron
 2. Shell
 3. 76
 4. Valero
 5. Arco
 6. Rotten Robbie
 7. Exit   
=====================================

First you must choose a specific brand gasoline station. 
Type in 1 for Chevron, 2 for Shell, 3 for 76, 5 for Arco, 6 for Rotten Robbie and 7 to exit. 

Then our program will prompt you to choose a specific octane gas. 

What octane gas would you like?

 1. Octane 87
 2. Octane 89
 3. Octane 91

You type in 1 for 87, 2 for 89, and 3 for 91. 

After doing so, our program will tell you the cheapest priced octane gasoline along with its street address. 

Finally, our program will ask if you would like to run the program again. 

Try again with a different brand gasoline?
1. Yes.
2. No.

Type 1 for Yes and 2 for No.
